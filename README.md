# vibe-claude

**For beginners who want results, not methodology.**

Multi-agent orchestration system that lets you describe what you want and gets it done. No learning curve. No cost optimization. Just results.

> Don't think. Just vibe. Claude handles the rest.

## Why vibe-claude?

**Other tools say:** "Learn TDD. Write plans first. Follow the methodology."

**vibe-claude says:** "Just tell me what you want."

```bash
/vibe Add user authentication with Google OAuth
```

That's it. vibe-claude will:
- Spawn Opus-tier agents (no cost cutting)
- Plan, implement, test, and review automatically
- Retry up to 10 times if something fails
- Only finish when it can PROVE it works

## Features

- **Zero Learning Curve** - Just describe what you want in plain language
- **Opus-First Philosophy** - Quality over cost. Always use the best model.
- **13 Specialized Agents** - Automatically delegated based on task type
- **Infinite Retry** - Up to 10 attempts with intelligent fallback strategies
- **Proven Completion** - Evidence-based verification, no "should work" claims
- **Session Continuity** - Checkpoint and resume across sessions

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install vibe-claude
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Maximum power mode - infinite retry until proven done
/vibe <task description>

# Parallel agent execution
/v-turbo <task description>

# Strategic planning session
/v-plan <task description>

# Systematic debugging
/v-debug <issue description>

# Quality review
/v-review

# Resume previous session
/v-continue

# Save/search knowledge
/v-memory save lesson "What I learned"
/v-memory search "error handling"

# Compress context for longer sessions
/v-compress
```

## Agent Tiers

| Tier | Agents | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Opus** | v-analyst, v-planner, v-critic, v-advisor, v-conductor, v-tester | Heavy analysis, planning, review |
| **Sonnet** | v-worker, v-designer, v-researcher, v-vision, v-api-tester | Execution, implementation |
| **Haiku** | v-finder, v-writer | Fast search, documentation |

## Core Principles

### Context is Precious

```
100% ████████████████████ Fresh session
 60% ████████████░░░░░░░░ Caution - consider /v-compress
 40% ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ WARNING - compress or checkpoint
 20% ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ DANGER - /clear recommended
```

### Two-Strike Rule

Same failure twice? Stop and reassess. Don't throw good context after bad.

### Evidence Required

Never claim done without proof:
- Actual command output
- Test results
- File:line references
