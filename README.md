# vibe-claude

**Claude Code Amplifier** - Performance-first guardrails for vanilla Claude Code.

We love Claude Code as it is. vibe-claude doesn't replace it - we amplify it. As Claude Code gets stronger, so does vibe-claude.

> Don't think. Just vibe. Claude handles the rest.

## Philosophy

**We don't replace Claude Code. We amplify it.**

```
Claude Code (vanilla)     →  Powerful engine
vibe-claude (guardrails)  →  Performance-first driving rules
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Together                  →  Maximum output with minimal overhead
```

As Anthropic improves Claude Code, vibe-claude automatically benefits. We add:
- Smart delegation patterns
- Context management rules
- Quality verification gates
- Session continuity

Nothing more. No bloat. No reinventing what Claude already does well.

## Why vibe-claude?

```bash
/vibe Add user authentication with Google OAuth
```

That's it. vibe-claude will:
- Delegate to the right agents automatically
- Manage context to extend your session
- Retry intelligently if something fails
- Only finish when it can PROVE it works

## Features

- **Performance-First** - Use the best model for each task, no compromises
- **Vanilla-Friendly** - Works with Claude Code, not against it
- **Zero Learning Curve** - Just describe what you want in plain language
- **13 Specialized Agents** - Automatically delegated based on task type
- **Infinite Retry** - Up to 10 attempts with intelligent fallback strategies
- **Proven Completion** - Evidence-based verification, no "should work" claims
- **Session Continuity** - Checkpoint and resume across sessions

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install vibe-claude
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Maximum power mode - infinite retry until proven done
/vibe <task description>

# Parallel agent execution
/v-turbo <task description>

# Strategic planning session
/v-plan <task description>

# Systematic debugging
/v-debug <issue description>

# Quality review
/v-review

# Resume previous session
/v-continue

# Save/search knowledge
/v-memory save lesson "What I learned"
/v-memory search "error handling"

# Compress context for longer sessions
/v-compress
```

## Agent Tiers

| Tier | Agents | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Opus** | v-analyst, v-planner, v-critic, v-advisor, v-conductor, v-tester | Heavy analysis, planning, review |
| **Sonnet** | v-worker, v-designer, v-researcher, v-vision, v-api-tester | Execution, implementation |
| **Haiku** | v-finder, v-writer | Fast search, documentation |

## Core Principles

### Context is Precious

```
100% ████████████████████ Fresh session
 60% ████████████░░░░░░░░ Caution - consider /v-compress
 40% ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ WARNING - compress or checkpoint
 20% ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ DANGER - /clear recommended
```

### Two-Strike Rule

Same failure twice? Stop and reassess. Don't throw good context after bad.

### Evidence Required

Never claim done without proof:
- Actual command output
- Test results
- File:line references
