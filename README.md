# vibe-claude

Multi-agent orchestration system for Claude Code with infinite retry, context management, and proven completion.

> Don't think. Just vibe. Claude evolves and completes it.

## Features

- **13 Specialized Agents** - Tiered by capability (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- **11 Powerful Skills** - vibe, v-turbo, v-plan, v-debug, v-review, and more
- **Context Management** - Two-Strike Rule, automatic compression, session handoff
- **Infinite Retry** - Up to 10 attempts with intelligent fallback strategies
- **Proven Completion** - Evidence-based verification, no "should work" claims
- **Session Continuity** - Checkpoint and resume across sessions

## Installation

```bash
claude plugin install vibe-claude
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Maximum power mode - infinite retry until proven done
/vibe <task description>

# Parallel agent execution
/v-turbo <task description>

# Strategic planning session
/v-plan <task description>

# Systematic debugging
/v-debug <issue description>

# Quality review
/v-review

# Resume previous session
/v-continue

# Save/search knowledge
/v-memory save lesson "What I learned"
/v-memory search "error handling"

# Compress context for longer sessions
/v-compress
```

## Agent Tiers

| Tier | Agents | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Opus** | v-analyst, v-planner, v-critic, v-advisor, v-conductor, v-tester | Heavy analysis, planning, review |
| **Sonnet** | v-worker, v-designer, v-researcher, v-vision, v-api-tester | Execution, implementation |
| **Haiku** | v-finder, v-writer | Fast search, documentation |

## Core Principles

### Context is Precious

```
100% ████████████████████ Fresh session
 60% ████████████░░░░░░░░ Caution - consider /v-compress
 40% ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░ WARNING - compress or checkpoint
 20% ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ DANGER - /clear recommended
```

### Two-Strike Rule

Same failure twice? Stop and reassess. Don't throw good context after bad.

### Evidence Required

Never claim done without proof:
- Actual command output
- Test results
- File:line references
