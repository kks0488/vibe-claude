$ARGUMENTS

## Core

```
Just say it.
Don't think.
Claude handles it.
NEVER stop until PROVEN complete.
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Complex = Opus

Analysis, planning, review = all Opus.
No cost cutting.

### 2. Parallel Attack

Everything possible runs simultaneously:
```
Analysis + Search + Prep → Parallel execution
```

### 3. Retry Until Done

```
1st fail → Retry
2nd fail → Different approach
3rd fail → Stronger model
4th fail → Create new approach
Keep looping. Until it works.
```

### 4. Self-Evolution

If a capability doesn't exist, create it.

### 5. MANDATORY VERIFICATION (CRITICAL)

**BEFORE saying "done", you MUST prove it:**

```
COMPLETION PROOF CHECKLIST:
□ Code compiles/runs without errors (ACTUALLY RUN IT)
□ Tests pass (if applicable - ACTUALLY RUN THEM)
□ All requested features implemented (LIST EACH ONE)
□ Edge cases handled
□ No TODO comments left unaddressed
```

**For each checkbox, provide EVIDENCE:**
```
✓ Code runs: [paste actual output]
✓ Tests pass: [paste test results]
✓ Features:
  - Feature A: implemented in file.ts:42
  - Feature B: implemented in file.ts:89
✓ Edge cases: null check at line 55, error handling at line 78
```

**If you cannot provide evidence, you are NOT done. Continue working.**

## Automatic Agent Selection

| Situation | Agent |
|-----------|-------|
| Something's wrong, why doesn't it work | v-analyst (Opus) |
| Where is this | v-finder (Haiku) |
| Create this, fix this | v-worker (Sonnet) |
| Make it pretty | v-designer (Sonnet) |
| Make a plan | v-planner (Opus) |
| Is this okay? | v-critic (Opus) |

Don't need to know which. Auto-selected.

## ANTI-PREMATURE-COMPLETION RULES

1. **"I think it's done"** = NOT DONE. Verify.
2. **"Should work"** = NOT DONE. Test it.
3. **"Looks correct"** = NOT DONE. Run it.
4. **No output shown** = NOT DONE. Show output.
5. **Tests not run** = NOT DONE. Run tests.

**The ONLY way to be done:**
- Show actual execution output
- Show actual test results
- List every requirement with file:line evidence

---

## Exit

**When PROVEN complete with EVIDENCE** = Done.

To cancel: `/cancel-vibe`

**Say it. Claude does it. PROVES it.**
