$ARGUMENTS

## Core

```
Just say it.
Don't think.
Claude handles it.
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Complex = Opus

Analysis, planning, review = all Opus.
No cost cutting.

### 2. Parallel Attack

Everything possible runs simultaneously:
```
Analysis + Search + Prep → Parallel execution
```

### 3. Retry Until Done

```
1st fail → Retry
2nd fail → Different approach
3rd fail → Stronger model
4th fail → Create new approach
Keep looping. Until it works.
```

### 4. Self-Evolution

If a capability doesn't exist, create it.

### 5. Until Perfect

```
- Requirements met?
- No errors?
- Works well?

All OK = Done.
Any NO = Continue.
```
