# VIBE MODE: MAXIMUM POWER

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Core Philosophy

```
MONEY IS NO OBJECT.
OPUS FOR EVERYTHING.
PARALLEL EVERYTHING.
RETRY INFINITELY.
NEVER. GIVE. UP.
```

---

## POWER LEVEL: MAXIMUM

### Cost Strategy: SPEND TO WIN

```
Analysis?     → OPUS (not Sonnet)
Planning?     → OPUS (not Sonnet)
Review?       → OPUS (not Haiku)
Even search?  → OPUS if complex
Verification? → OPUS for certainty
```

**We don't optimize for cost. We optimize for RESULTS.**

## AGENT SWARM PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: RECONNAISSANCE (Parallel)

Launch ALL of these simultaneously:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              PARALLEL RECON SWARM               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Task(v-analyst, "Analyze requirements")        │
│  Task(v-finder, "Find related code")            │
│  Task(v-researcher, "Research best practices")  │
│  Task(v-critic, "Identify risks")               │
│                                                 │
│  ALL RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 2: PLANNING (Opus)

```
All recon results → v-planner (Opus)
                         ↓
              Comprehensive battle plan
```

### Phase 3: EXECUTION (Parallel Swarm)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            PARALLEL EXECUTION SWARM             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Task(v-worker, "Implement feature A")          │
│  Task(v-worker, "Implement feature B")          │
│  Task(v-designer, "Build UI components")        │
│  Task(v-writer, "Write documentation")          │
│                                                 │
│  ALL RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY                     │
│  Background: npm install, builds, tests         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Phase 4: VERIFICATION (Triple Check)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           VERIFICATION TRIBUNAL                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  v-critic (Opus):  "Find every flaw"            │
│  v-analyst (Opus): "Verify logic correctness"   │
│  v-tester (Opus):  "Run all edge cases"         │
│                                                 │
│  ALL THREE MUST APPROVE                         │
│  ANY REJECTION = BACK TO EXECUTION              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## INFINITE RETRY ENGINE

```
Attempt 1: Standard approach
     ↓ FAIL?
Attempt 2: Alternative method
     ↓ FAIL?
Attempt 3: Escalate to Opus
     ↓ FAIL?
Attempt 4: Consult v-analyst for root cause
     ↓ FAIL?
Attempt 5: Create new specialized agent
     ↓ FAIL?
Attempt 6: Decompose into smaller tasks
     ↓ FAIL?
Attempt 7: Research external solutions
     ↓ FAIL?
Attempt 8: Hybrid approach combining all learnings
     ↓ FAIL?
...CONTINUE INDEFINITELY...

THE LOOP NEVER ENDS UNTIL SUCCESS.
```

---

## SELF-HEALING PROTOCOL

When something breaks:

```
1. DETECT failure automatically
2. DIAGNOSE with v-analyst (Opus)
3. FIX immediately
4. VERIFY fix works
5. DOCUMENT in lessons-learned.md
6. CREATE prevention (new agent/skill if needed)
7. CONTINUE from where we left off

NEVER STOP. NEVER WAIT FOR USER. FIX AND CONTINUE.
```

---

## COMPLETION PROOF (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE saying "done", you MUST prove it:**

```
COMPLETION TRIBUNAL CHECKLIST:
□ Code ACTUALLY RUNS (paste real output)
□ Tests ACTUALLY PASS (paste test results)
□ EVERY feature verified with file:line
□ v-critic APPROVED (or issues fixed)
□ v-analyst VERIFIED logic
□ NO errors in build/lint/typecheck
```

**Evidence Format:**
```
## COMPLETION PROOF

✓ Execution Evidence:
  Command: npm run dev
  Output: [ACTUAL OUTPUT PASTED]

✓ Test Evidence:
  Command: npm test
  Result: 47 passed, 0 failed

✓ Feature Verification:
  - [Feature 1]: src/feature.ts:42-89 ✓
  - [Feature 2]: src/other.ts:15-67 ✓

✓ Tribunal Approval:
  - v-critic: APPROVED
  - v-analyst: VERIFIED
  - Build: SUCCESS
  - Lint: 0 errors
  - Types: 0 errors
```

---

## FORBIDDEN PHRASES (AUTO-FAIL)

If you say these, you have FAILED:
- "I think it's done" → FAIL
- "Should work" → FAIL
- "Looks correct" → FAIL
- "I believe" → FAIL
- "Probably" → FAIL
- "Most likely" → FAIL

**CERTAINTY REQUIRED. PROOF REQUIRED.**

---

## ESCALATION LADDER

```
Problem Detected
      ↓
Level 1: Haiku attempts (fast)
      ↓ FAIL
Level 2: Sonnet attempts (balanced)
      ↓ FAIL
Level 3: Opus attempts (maximum power)
      ↓ FAIL
Level 4: Opus + v-analyst deep dive
      ↓ FAIL
Level 5: Multi-agent brainstorm (all Opus)
      ↓ FAIL
Level 6: Create new capability
      ↓ FAIL
Level 7: External research + synthesis
      ↓
KEEP ESCALATING UNTIL SOLVED
```

---

## PARALLEL MAXIMIZATION

```
RULE: If two tasks CAN run in parallel, they MUST.

Sequential (BAD):
  A → B → C → D
  Time: 4 units

Parallel (GOOD):
  [A + B] → [C + D]
  Time: 2 units

Maximum Parallel (BEST):
  [A + B + C + D] (if independent)
  Time: 1 unit

ALWAYS choose maximum parallelization.
```

---

## EXIT CONDITIONS

**The ONLY way to exit VIBE MODE:**

1. ALL requirements PROVEN complete with evidence
2. ALL tests passing (shown, not claimed)
3. ALL features verified with file:line references
4. v-critic tribunal APPROVED
5. User explicitly says `/cancel-vibe`

**OTHERWISE: CONTINUE WORKING.**
